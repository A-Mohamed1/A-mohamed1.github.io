## Project Overview

This project involves the comprehensive mathematical modeling, design, and transient performance analysis of a simplified cold gas rocket engine system.

The study focuses on the gas dynamics of a pressurized oxidizer source and its temporal evolution as tank pressure depletes during operation.

## System Configuration and Specifications

The engine model consists of three primary components designed to simulate high-performance propulsion:

- **Pressurized Tank:** A 0.5 m³ cold gas tank pressurized with air to an initial pressure of 200 bar.
- **Combustor (Heat Addition Duct):** A one-dimensional duct that simulates a combustion chamber by adding thermal energy, raising the gas temperature to a maximum of 2200 K.
- **Convergent–Divergent (CD) Nozzle:** A fixed-geometry nozzle designed at a 100-bar reference condition to optimize mass flow rate and expansion behavior.

---

## Methodology and Physical Modeling

The project utilizes an unsteady flow model based on the fundamental conservation of mass and energy. Key theoretical frameworks include:

- **Isentropic Blowdown:** Used to model gas depletion inside the tank, treated as a lumped control volume.
- **Rayleigh Flow:** Applied to estimate total pressure losses resulting from heat addition within the combustor duct.
- **Shock Logic:** Determines whether the nozzle operates in an underexpanded supersonic state or if a normal shock forms inside the nozzle due to pressure decay.

---

## Key Performance Results

The simulation, conducted over a 50-second blowdown period, yielded the following insights:

- **Thrust and Flow:** Initial thrust of approximately **8.5 kN** with a mass flow rate near **4 kg/s**.
- **Thermal Efficiency:** Heat addition introduces a realistic **4.8% stagnation pressure loss**, minimized by maintaining low Mach numbers (0.1–0.3) in the heating duct.
- **Transient Behavior:** A performance discontinuity occurs at approximately **14 seconds**, marking the transition where tank pressure can no longer sustain supersonic exit flow, causing a shock to propagate into the nozzle.
- **Physical Consistency:** Final design results in a combustor diameter of **0.0861 m**, providing a cross-sectional area approximately **5.8× larger than the throat**, ensuring efficient heat addition.

## Technical Implementation

The system was validated using **MATLAB simulations** to generate thrust–time curves and temporal profiles for tank pressure and temperature.

This analytical approach enabled a detailed understanding of how initial conditions and thermal energy addition dictate the lifecycle and propulsion performance of the engine.

## Key Mathematical Frameworks
---

### 1. Isentropic Tank Blowdown

The tank is modeled as a lumped control volume undergoing an **isentropic expansion**. Pressure and temperature are updated at each time step based on changes in gas density:

**Pressure update:**
$$
P_{\text{tank}}^{n+1} = P_{\text{tank}}^{n}
\left( \frac{\rho_{\text{new}}}{\rho_{\text{old}}} \right)^{\gamma}
$$

**Temperature update:**
$$
T_{\text{tank}}^{n+1} = T_{\text{tank}}^{n}
\left( \frac{\rho_{\text{new}}}{\rho_{\text{old}}} \right)^{\gamma - 1}
$$

---

### 2. Nozzle Mass Flow Rate (Choked Flow)

When the nozzle operates under **choked conditions**, the mass flow rate is governed by the stagnation conditions and throat area:

$$
\dot{m} =
P_0 A^*
\sqrt{
\frac{\gamma}{R T_0}
\left( \frac{2}{\gamma + 1} \right)^{\frac{\gamma + 1}{\gamma - 1}}
}
$$

where:
- $P_0$ is the stagnation pressure  
- $T_0$ is the stagnation temperature  
- $A^*$ is the throat area  

---

### 3. Rayleigh Flow (Heat Addition)

To simulate combustion, heat is added to the flow, increasing the gas temperature to **2200 K**.  
This results in a loss of stagnation pressure governed by Rayleigh flow relations:

$$
\frac{P_{02}}{P_{01}} =
\frac{1 + \gamma M_2^2}{1 + \gamma M_1^2}
\left(
\frac{1 + \frac{\gamma - 1}{2} M_1^2}
{1 + \frac{\gamma - 1}{2} M_2^2}
\right)^{\frac{\gamma - 1}{\gamma}}
$$

---

### 4. Normal Shock and Exit Conditions

As tank pressure decreases, the nozzle may no longer sustain supersonic flow, causing a **normal shock** to move inside the nozzle.

The shock Mach number is determined from the pressure balance:

$$
P_{\text{sup}}
\left( 1 + \frac{\gamma + 1}{2\gamma} (M_s^2 - 1) \right)
= P_{\text{atm}}
$$

The exit Mach number after the shock is:

$$
M_e =
\sqrt{
\frac{\gamma M_s^2 - \frac{2}{\gamma - 1}}
{1 + \frac{2}{\gamma - 1} M_s^2}
}
$$

---

### 5. Propulsion Performance

The total thrust is calculated as the sum of **momentum thrust** and **pressure thrust**:

$$
F = \dot{m} V_e + (P_e - P_{\text{atm}}) A_e
$$

The exit velocity is given by:

$$
V_e = M_e \sqrt{\gamma R T_e}
$$

The exit temperature is:

$$
T_e =
\frac{T_0}{1 + \frac{\gamma - 1}{2} M_e^2}
$$

---

### 6. Combustor Geometry Design

To ensure efficient heat addition, the combustor is designed to operate at a **low inlet Mach number** $(M_c = 0.1)$.

The required combustor area is:

$$
A_c =
\frac{\dot{m} \sqrt{T_0}}
{P_0}
\sqrt{
\frac{R}{\gamma}
}
\frac{1}{M_c}
\left(
1 + \frac{\gamma - 1}{2} M_c^2
\right)^{\frac{\gamma + 1}{2(\gamma - 1)}}
$$

The corresponding combustor diameter is:

$$
D_c = \sqrt{\frac{4 A_c}{\pi}}
$$
